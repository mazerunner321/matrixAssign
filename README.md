# Crypto

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a user interface (UI) based on the Figma design specifications, using ReactJS and Vanilla CSS as the tech stack. The primary goal is to fetch and display data from the Dexscreener API based on user input, specifically, the pair/token address. The UI follows the design instructions closely and displays the data for at most 10 pairs in descending order of price in USD.
